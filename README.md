## Purpose
The objective of this project is to analyze a data challenge existing in the city of Chicago. I chose to analyze data on Chicago public schools and Chicago parks to see if there is a link between the performance of students and the classifications of parks in areas surrounding the school. Studies show that children and students need extracurriricular activites that take place outside the classroom in order to develop and strengthen their soft skills, like interpersonal communication. The acquisition of these skills significantly impact the future success. On the other side of the spectrum, in areas with more organized crime, parks may be used as places to gather and spread crime. Students may slowly pull away from school to participate in negative activities. 

## Results
Two files, Above_Average.txt and Far_Below_Average.txt, document the list of schools performing above average and far below average, respectively, as well as name and classification of parks that have the same zip code. The last lines of each file tally the number of types of each park.
