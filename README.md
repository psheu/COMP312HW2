## Purpose
The objective of this project is to analyze a data challenge existing in the city of Chicago. I chose to analyze data on Chicago public schools and Chicago parks to see if there is a link between the performance of students and the classifications of parks in areas surrounding the school. Studies show that children and students need extracurriricular activites that take place outside the classroom in order to develop and strengthen their soft skills, like interpersonal communication. The acquisition of these skills significantly impact the future success.
